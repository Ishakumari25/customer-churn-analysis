Customer churn occurs when customers stop using a service.
This project analyzes customer data to identify churn patterns.

##  Objective
- Understand customer behavior
- Identify factors affecting churn
- Predict customer churn using ML

##  Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Telco Customer Churn)
- Type: CSV file
- Data includes customer details and churn status

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  Steps Followed
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation

##  Results
- Churn is higher for month-to-month customers
- Logistic Regression gives good accuracy
